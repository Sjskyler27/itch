# Itch

## About the Project

We created Itch to help teach programming skills to young developing minds. We sought to remove some of the difficult syntax and and language of traditional high-powered coding languages. For this purpose we have created **Itch**, a simplified high-level text-based coding language that is especially designed for the next generation of programmers. We aim to help kids explore this as a potential hobby and future interest. We understand how being introduced to programming early in a child's life can open your mind to a whole new world of possibilities. **Itch** is a full interactive learning experience for kids to explore writing code, make progress on challenges, and be creative in their own way. There are tutorials and documentation specifically designed with our users in mind.

## About us

We are five CSE students at Brigham Young University-Idaho who made this together as a part of a 24-hour Hackathon event. We enjoy programming and are passionate about helping educate others about it. We each have different levels of experience and have brought our unique ideas and perspectives to this project.
