Here is an example of what you could type: <p><code>favoriteColor is Blue</code></p>Another example for a variable could be <p><code>cookies is 12</code></p>if you have 12 cookies.

A good example is <p><code>if 5 = 5</code></p> then on the next line tab and type <p><code>write This math is correct!</code></p>. In addition to using "=" with if statements we can also use "!" which means "does not equal". Here is an example: "if 5 ! 6" "This math is correct!".
